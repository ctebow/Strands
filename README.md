# CMSC 14200 Course Project

Team members:
- GUI: James Rosenberger (jmrosenberger)
- TUI: Anna Sokolova (annsok0l)
- Art: Caden Tebow (ctebow)
- QA:  Derrick Young (dvyoung)

Enhancements:

1) GUI-SOUND: Can pass in normal Play or Show mode command-line arguments to test,
although enhancement for Play mode is more extensive. I've added sounds
from https://kenney.nl/assets/category:Audio?search=&sort=update
for starting the game, quitting/exiting, clicking, clearing by
hitting escape, submitting a too short, non-dictionary, or repeated word,
and for both submitting a new dictionary and new
strand word. Enjoy!
